# Contributing (Phase 0)

## Non-negotiables
- The system **does not decide** training actions. It outputs **scenarios** with uncertainty.
- Every suggestion must be **explainable** and have a **confidence** (even if low).
- The human (athlete/coach) remains the authority.

## Workflow
- Create feature branches
- Add/extend tests for every rule
- Keep modules small and versionable
